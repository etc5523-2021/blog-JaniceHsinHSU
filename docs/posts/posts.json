    "contents": "\nMy first experiences in Bahrain\nBahrain was only a really unfamiliar country name for me until I received a job opportunity as a project manager that had to travel to Bahrain in 2018. It has been three years since I went to Bahrain, but I still remember the heat, the desert and the hospitality that Bahrainis has offered me. I didn’t get to spend a lot of time traveling around, especially because it was the fasting season when I went that I didn’t even have the chance to really enjoy the food there. However, it was one of the special places that I have ever been.\nThis is the photo of a lamp shop that I took in the market:\n\n\n\nBahrain was one of the hottest country that I have ever been that it hit 43 when I was there.
