## My first experiences in Bahrain


Bahrain was only a really unfamiliar country name for me until I received a job opportunity as a project manager that had to travel to Bahrain in 2018. It has been three years since I went to Bahrain, but I still remember the heat, the desert and the hospitality that Bahrainis has offered me. I didn't get to spend a lot of time traveling around, especially because it was the fasting season when I went that I didn't even have the chance to really enjoy the food there. However, it was one of the special places that I have ever been.

This is the photo of a lamp shop that I took in the market:

```


Bahrain was one of the hottest country that I have ever been that it hit 43 when I was there. I still remember how hot my glasses frame was, and it was also really sandy!

(I took this picture from the hotel window)

## How Covid-19 hit Bahrain

Pandemic hit the entire world since 2020, even for the small countries like Bahrain. 

```{r}
data <- read_csv("time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv")
```

```{r}
data_tidy <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `1/22/20`:`8/30/21`, names_to = "dates",
               values_to = "cases") %>%
  mutate(dates = mdy(dates)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(dates), funs(year, month, day)) 

bah <- data_tidy %>%
  filter(`Country/Region` == "Bahrain")
```

```{r}
data_tidy <- data_tidy %>%
  mutate(case_yesterday = lag(cases, n = 1),
        daily_increase = cases - case_yesterday )
bah <- bah %>%
  mutate(case_yesterday = lag(cases, n = 1),
        daily_increase = cases - case_yesterday )
```

This is the total cumulative cases in the world and also in Bahrain for comparison.

```{r covid_situation_in_Bahrain}
g1 <- data_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dates, y = cases))+
  geom_col(col = "steelblue")+
ggtitle("World situation")
g2 <- bah %>%
ggplot(aes(x = dates, y = cases))+
  geom_col(col = "steelblue")+
  ggtitle("Bahrain")

grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol =2)
```


```{r table1}
bah %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(`monthly increase` = sum(daily_increase)) %>%
   knitr::kable(
  caption = "Cases in each month") %>%
  kable_styling(c("hover", "striped"))
```
