When it rains, it pours, but in Afghanistan, it's drought. I would say this idiom can describe Afghanistan's situation right on point. "The now-absent government at Kabul had declared drought on June 22; half of its 30 million people are below the poverty line while 7,000 COVID-19 deaths have taken place("Taliban take-over: Afghanistan already battling drought, hunger, COVID-19", 2021)

I am writing this post about Covid-19 based on an assignment. Just like what I usually do, pour a cup of coffee and sit in front of my laptop writing down codes and texts. This should have not been a hard task. Yet the more I write the more grief and guilt grows. I even feel cruel when I am writing down the story based on Afghan's lives without being able to do anything for those innocents, injured children, harmed elders, and the damaged land. However, this is an even more heart-breaking and unfortunate for the fate of the people of Afghanistan. Not only are they suffering from COVID, they also have put up a fight against the Taliban. My heart goes to the people in Afghanistan.

Biden ordered troops to evacuate about 640 Afghans to Qatar from the capital, Kabul, in late August. Obviously, their lives were at risk, and time was so short that the essential protection of COVID by wearing face masks were impossible.

"As the situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate rapidly, WHO is extremely concerned over the unfolding safety and humanitarian needs in the country, including risk of disease outbreaks and rise in COVID-19 transmission," said a 17 August WHO update. (Henderson & Sc., 2021)


## The Covid-19 situation in Afganistan

Again, I use the data from John Hopkins University. However, I am highly doubtful for the numbers that I have. Of course I trust John Hopkins, the source is reliable. What I am doubting at, is the collection of the data. When I search "Covid in Afghanistan", most of the news I see is how experts worry about the spread of Covid or the lack of health care in Afghanistan. However, for people who actually live in Afghanistan, might not know which one they should fear more, Covid or Taliban?

We all know that Covid is the enemy for the entire world. However, in Afghanistan, people who fight with Covid and provide aids for patients were harmed or dead because of the Taliban." the Taliban continued abducting healthcare workers and attacked a pharmacy; the Afghan national security forces carried out deliberate acts of violence and intimidation affecting a healthcare facility, workers and the delivery of medical supplies; and unknown gunmen perpetrated an abhorrent
attack on a maternity ward in a hospital in Kabul, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties.(SPECIAL REPORT: ATTACKS ON HEALTHCARE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, 2021)"


## Data decription

The data is retrieved from [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) which is collected by Johns Hopkins University.

The dataset in this post contains the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus from 22nd of January in 2020 to 13st of September in 2021. I transferred the data into a long format, so that the dates can be shown in a single column. The dataset also includes variables such as Province, Country/Region and latitude as in lat, longitude as in long.

I also use the data from [OCHA Afghanistan](https://www.unocha.org/afghanistan) to discover the displace due to the conflicts.

## Analysis and Findings

```{r}
data <- read_csv("time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv") 
data_tidy <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `1/22/20`:`9/13/21`, names_to = "dates",
               values_to = "cases") %>%
  mutate(dates = mdy(dates)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(dates), funs(year, month, day)) 

afg <- data_tidy %>%
  filter(`Country/Region` == "Afghanistan")
```


```{r}
data_tidy <- data_tidy %>%
  mutate(case_yesterday = lag(cases, n = 1),
        daily_increase = cases - case_yesterday )
afg <- afg %>%
  mutate(case_yesterday = lag(cases, n = 1),
        daily_increase = cases - case_yesterday )
```

### Confirmed Covid cases

```{r}
afg %>%
ggplot(aes(x = dates, y = daily_increase))+
  geom_col(col = "steelblue")+
  labs(title = "Confirmed Cases in Afganaistan",
    x = "Dates", 
       y = "Daily Increase")+
  theme(text = element_text(color = "white"),
        rect = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"))
```
The confirmed cases in Afganiastan is reaching a peak high as shown above during July. According to multiple news reports,the reasons are: the most serious drought that happened during June 2021, NGOs and health organizations are evacuating out of Afghanistan due to the takeover of the Taliban. Therefore, the people fled the country in a rush, and with the scarcity of natural resources and good health environment. People couldn't care more about wearing face masks during the flee. Therefore, leading to the rising numbers of COVID infections. 
### Deaths caused by Covid

```{r}
death <- read_csv("time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv") 
death_tidy <- death %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `1/22/20`:`9/13/21`, names_to = "dates",
               values_to = "cases") %>%
  mutate(dates = mdy(dates)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(dates), funs(year, month, day)) 

death_tidy <- death_tidy %>%
  mutate(case_yesterday = lag(cases, n = 1),
        daily_increase = cases - case_yesterday )

afg_death <- death_tidy %>%
  filter(`Country/Region` == "Afghanistan")


afg_death <- afg_death %>%
  mutate(case_yesterday = lag(cases, n = 1),
        daily_increase = cases - case_yesterday )
```

```{r}
afg_death %>%
ggplot(aes(x = dates, y = daily_increase))+
  geom_col(col = "steelblue")+
  labs(title = "Death Cases in Afganaistan",
    x = "Dates", 
       y = "Daily Increase") +
  theme(text = element_text(color = "white"),
        rect = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"))
```



The death cases in Afganiastan is relatively low comparing to the infection cases, which is highly suspicious and rare. As I mentioned above that health kits and face masks are scarce, I decided to do a deeper search on the death cases, and to my surprise, health officials are being gunned down and also faced life threats because of the Taliban. I would suggest that, this is the reason that lies behind the low death rate, because the government is not running the country, and so the numbers reported above is way lower than the actual death rate. Even though the WHO promised to stay and help out with essentials of COVID supplies. The truth is, it's still not enough to save Afghans' lives. 

### Covid Precaution in Afghanistan 

Taliban’s control of Afghanistan during the covid period was due to them wearing precautionary protective masks to fight against the globally spread virus. Well, that’s what many people believe and to support this argument a CNN news headline screenshot has been shared widely in social media. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Picture_1.png")
```


In this section we are not going to discuss the validity of this picture. We are going to analyse the current Covid precautionary activities that are done in Afghanistan. The World Health Organization (WHO) is ready to send their medical supplies and assistance to the country, however this is rejected by the now ruling Taliban with violent attacks. 

One good prevention method (till date) is the intake of vaccine. That is a disturbing fact for Afghanistan. Taliban banned the use of Covid vaccines in some regions of the country (Shamshad News, 2021). This is the only inside news I could find so situation of other regions is still in dark. Taliban had previously banned polio vaccines in the regions they used to control so the current situation was predictable. There are accurate data for the current vaccinated numbers. But the U.N. reports in August 2021 that several 2 million vaccines were administrated in a country having 40 million as its population (Full Fact, 2021). 

There are reports of drastic decrease in the number of vaccine intake. However, the validity of such reports is questionable as they are not from inside sources. The residents of the country also do not follow the protocol of wearing a mask and keeping safe social distance. According to WHO, they have many other issues that they must face like diarrhea, malnutrition, high blood pressure, COVID-19-like symptoms and reproductive health complications (SciDev, 2021). Can you blame them? No! Each day for them is a fight for survival of the strongest. 


### Displacements caused by conflicts

```{r}
displacement <- read_csv("afghanistan_conflict_displacements_2021.csv") 
displacement <- displacement %>%
  mutate(DISP_DATE = dmy(DISP_DATE),
         DISP_IND = as.numeric(DISP_IND),
         DISP_FAM = as.numeric(DISP_FAM),
         DISP_ADULT_MALE = as.numeric(DISP_ADULT_MALE),
         DISP_ADULT_FEMALE = as.numeric(DISP_ADULT_FEMALE),
         DISP_CHILDREN_U18= as.numeric(DISP_CHILDREN_U18))
```

```{r}
g1 <- displacement %>%
  group_by(DISP_DATE) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(DISP_IND, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DISP_DATE, y = total)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1)+
  labs(title = "Displacement Individuals in Afganaistan",
    x = "Dates", 
       y = "Daily Amount") +
  theme(text = element_text(color = "white"),
        rect = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"))

g2 <- displacement %>%
  group_by(DISP_DATE) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(DISP_ADULT_FEMALE, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DISP_DATE, y = total)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1)+
  labs(title = "Displacement Females in Afganaistan",
    x = "Dates", 
       y = "Daily Amount") +
  theme(text = element_text(color = "white"),
        rect = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"))

g3 <- displacement %>%
  group_by(DISP_DATE) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(DISP_CHILDREN_U18, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DISP_DATE, y = total)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1)+
  labs(title = "Displacement Children Under 18 in Afganaistan",
    x = "Dates", 
       y = "Daily Amount") +
  theme(text = element_text(color = "white"),
        rect = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"))


grid.arrange(g1, g2, g3)
```

This is the amount of displacement in 2021, some data might not be fully recorded because of the current serious conflicts in Afghanistan. This is not only a disaster for each individual or family, the displacement can potentially cause the outburst of Covid because the spread or human movement cannot be under control anymore.
